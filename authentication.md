## Web Tokens

Web tokens are a type of token-based authentication mechanism used in web applications. They are used to securely transmit information between parties and are commonly used for user authentication.

To generate a web token, you can use the `generateToken` function provided by the auth module. This function takes in the user's credentials and returns a unique token that can be used for authentication.

Here is an example of how to generate a web token:

```python
token = auth.generateToken(username, password)
```

To validate a web token and check its expiration, you can use the `validateToken` function provided by the auth module. This function takes in the token and checks if it is valid and has not expired.

Here is an example of how to validate a web token:

```python
isValid = auth.validateToken(token)
if isValid:
    # Token is valid
else:
    # Token is invalid or has expired
```

By using web tokens for authentication, you can ensure secure and reliable authentication in your web application.
